<p>Punjabi University was established on April 30, 1962. Originally conceived and started as 
a unitary multi-faculty teaching and research university and primarily meant for the 
development and enrichment of Punjabi language and culture, but alive to the social and 
educational requirements of the state, it grew into an affiliating one in 1969. It has since 
developed in significant dimensions and acquired a distinctive character among the centres of 
education and research in the country. The university campus is situated on 
the Patiala Chandigarh road, at a distance of 7 km from the main city. Sprawling across 
316 acres, the campus is away from the din and noise of the city markets and roads. It 
presents a splendid sight of the complex of beautiful buildings which include:<br><br>
