<p>Established on April 30, 1962 in the erstwhile princely state of Patiala with the 
main objective of furthering the cause of Punjabi language, art and literature,
 Punjabi University has since evolved into the largest University in the state.
 Spread over 600 acres of land, its 500 teachers are imparting instruction and 
 guidance to nearly 9,000 students in a multi-faceted, multi-pronged and multi-
 faculty environment comprising 65 Teaching and Research Departments on its 
 Campus, five Regional Centres, six Neighbourhood Campuses and 166 
 Colleges affiliated to it<br><br><p>
 <p>A mutually-stimulating qualitative and quantitative swing in the direction of
 overall improvement marks the dynamics and mechanics of Punjabi University.
 Its multi-dimensional expansion has not only been quick-paced but steady, sustained and seamless, 
 way for the other. It didn't come across any cul de sac with unstinted support ever-forthcoming from its committed and 
 resolute faculty. "Unprecedented and unique landmarks", "Innovative and grandiose concepts", "Unimaginable reforms",
 "Setting new landmarks and records" could easily be attributed as some of the catchphrases describing its unabated progress.
 The University has achieved a couple of milestones during its move towards furthering the overall development of Punjabi. 
 Having published a record number of over 3,000 titles in Punjabi covering a wide range of areas and
establishing a special Punjabi Reference Library, it has taken upon itself the responsibility of catering to the linguistic and 
cultural needs of the overseas Punjabis.<br><br><p>
<p>The Punjabi reference Library has been created to build up a strong collection on Punjab history, culture, language and 
literature. The rich collection of over 1, 00,000 documents, of which around 58,000 have been donated by noted litt√©rateurs 
and historians, add to the proud privilege of the Punjabi University. It alsotains all Punjabi newspapers, magazines,
 books, diaries and rare manuscripts pertaining to the 19th and 20thcenturies. More than 120 Punjabi newspapers and 
 periodicals published anywhere in the world are available in this Library.<br><br></p>
 <p><font color="blue"> University's main Library</font> on the other hand, stocks more than 5,00,000 
volumes and subscribes to more than 600 journals. It has a 400-capacity 
majestic Reading Hall for readers to consult various types of source material. 
The other characteristics features of these libraries constitute Online Public 
access Catalogue, database of 2, 00,000 documents, internet facility, current 
awareness and documentation services, indexing services of newspapers, 
subject bibliographies, inter-library loan facility, computerized bibliographic 
and documentation and reprographic services. The University also has 
libraries at its satellite campuses at its Mohali, Dehradun, Malerkotla, 
Bathinda and Talwandi Sabo. Dr Balbir singh Sahitya Kenda, Dehradun 
stands out containing valuable collection of manuscripts, rare books, tracts 
and memoris.<br><br>
The establishment of a Centre for Teaching of Punjabi as a Foreign Language (CTPFL) and an Advanced Centre for 
Technical Development of Punjabi Language, Literature and Culture (ACTDPLC) are the foremost instruments aimed at 
reaching out to the global community. While the CTPFL has already taught Punjabi to over 100 seekers from the USA, 
Canada, Russia, China and Singapore, the ACTDPLC has chipped in with providing a package for learning Gurmukhi/ 
Punjabi online, besides creating software for inter-script transfer between Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi.  The Centre has now 
accomplished the unique distinction of launching the first of its kind a search engine in Punjabi.<br><br>
The University has also started short-term linguistic and culture immersion programmes for the overseas Punjabi Youth for
fostering a better understanding of Punjabi culture and heritage through different means. A World Punjabi Centre is also 
being established on the University Campus to provide a fillip to the multi-dimensional nursing and flourishing of Punjabi as 
a whole. The University has also created special departments to promote research in Punjabi which include Department of
 Punjabi Literary Studies, Development of Punjabi Language and Punjabi Lexicography.<br><br>
Such projects of English translation of Bhai Kahan Singh Nabha Encyclopedia of Punjabi, Punjabi translation of works of 
Nobel Laureates and starting of Punjabi folk youth festival for the revival and promotion of vanishing Punjabi folk art forms 
are certain concrete steps taken by Punjabi university to provide a fillip to the overall development of Punjabi. The 
University added another feather to its cap in the direction of promotion of Punjabi language by launching its website in 
Punjabi in addition to its existing one, available at www.punjabiuniversity.ac.in. In order to develop a deep-rooted 
association with outstanding Punjabi scholars, it bestows them with various kinds of fellowship.<br><br>
The University has scaled new heights in the direction of strengthening and spreading the religious ethos and quintessence,
 particularly that of Sikhism. Earlier having established a full-fledged Department of Guru Granth Studies and Guru Gobind 
 Singh Department of Religious Studies, the University has published first of its kind, the Encyclopaedia of Sikhism in four 
 volumes. The Encyclopaedia, inter alia,   contains complete details about Sikh history, philosophy, theology, art and 
 architecture, customs, ceremonies and shrines etc. The work having undergone several reprints testifies to the authenticity 
 and catholicity of its contents, its terse style, its impeccable and flawless English idiom, has contributed a lot in fertilizing 
 Sikh learning. The Encyclopaedia has now been put online to widen its horizon among religious scholars around the globe.
 Keeping the objective of wider deliverance of the divine message of Guru Granth Sahib, the University has now framed a 
 design for the on-line teaching of Guru Granth Sahib in a simple and interactive manner by using multimedia tools and 
 techniques.<br><br>
 Earlier, the University established a separate and specialized Department of Gurmat Sangeet, aimed at propagation and 
 preservation of Gurubani through the exclusive genre of devotional music. It also aimed at providing an academic and 
 scholastic base to this original and unique musical tradition in addition to creating awareness about its transcendental 
 quality across diverse cultures.<br><br>
In addition to accelerating the pace of meeting its primary obligation to fostering the academic, intellectual and scholastic 
standards, the University has been making genuine and unstinted efforts for the rural upliftment of society through various 
means. It all started with the opening up of Yadavindra College of Engineering at Talwandi Sabo in 2004. The University 
has carried out this formidable task in its own humble way to take the higher education to the doorsteps of ruralites and to 
address to the concerns of the donors of such vast infrastructure. This has also been done to tackle the problem of 
considerably low percentage of rural students (0.4%) getting higher education as a consequence of low quality education
 and utterly poor socio-economic conditions of these ruralites. To award a clear advantage to the rural youth where the
 Neighborhood Campuses have been launched, the University has made a provision of 50% reservation for the students from 
 the concerned sub-division and the remaining 50% to be admitted from the rest of the rural Punjab.<br><br>
The starting of six-year integrated course in Engineering at the Yadavindra College of Engineering at Talwandi Sabo is a 
pioneer step of the University to reach the unreachable and the uncared-for. The students enrolled for this course hail from 
the poorest sections of the rural population in the most backward region of Punjab. Notably, they do not have to pay their 
fee for the entire course that comes up to Rs 45,000 per year which has been solicited from generous donors.<br><br>

Covering 84 acres of land and occupying 3.75 lakh sq. ft. of covered area, the 
YCoE has already over 1,600 students on its rolls for its various courses which 
include M.Tech, M.C.A., six-year B.Tech. integrated course and four-year
 B.Tech. with facilities to follow these courses up to doctorate level. After taking 
 over the Campus, our University has already spent over Rs 25 crore for 
 creating state-of-the art infrastructure which includes seven computer labs,
 mechanical engineering workshop, up-to-date electronic labs, 2 Mpbs radio-
 link internet connectivity, boys' and girls' hostels, teachers flats, well-stocked 
 library and playfields  and a language lab to improve the communication skills 
 of  the rural students.<br><br>
A recent survey carried out by our Department of Economics has revealed that 
the combined strength of rural students in the four Universities of Punjab,
 including the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, is just four per cent. 
 By implication, this means that of the total Rs 165 crore budgetary allocations 
 by the Government for the Universities in the state, the rural students get a
 share of just about Rs 7.30 crore, while the population of ruralites is more than 66 per cent. We recognized the reality of 
 collapse of school education in rural Punjab and quietly filled the gap by picking up students after tenth class. They do not 
 have to pay their fee of Rs 45,000 per year. This has been done to redeem the deprived rural youth who find themselves
 haggard and dithered against the pampered passions of metroites and big-town-dwellers and leveling them up in all respects 
 to fight it out in this world of convergence and globalization<br><br>
 Following these startling revelations, the University took up the cudgels of addressing to the grave concerns of the rural 
 down and outs by opening Neighbourhood Campuses in six remote and virtually written-off villages of Rampura Phul, 
 Jhunir, Karandi, Sardulgarh, Rallah and Delha Sihan existing in the most backward districts of Bathinda, Mansa and 
 Sangrur. The most significant aspect of this magnanimous venture is that the village panchayats of these areas have donated 
 over 300 acres of land costing more than Rs 100 crore.<br><br>
We have already spent Rs 1.10 crore for the renovation, furnishing and making the latest equipment available 
to the students to the students of the Neighbourhood Campuses. Responding to the repeated requests from village heads, the University has 
now planned to start new vocational courses in these Neighborhood Campuses from the forthcoming academic session like 
M.Sc. (Information Technology),MCA, B.Sc.(Biotechnology), B.Tech.(Electronics and Communication Engineering, and 
Computer Engineering) and PG Diploma in Computer Maintenance & Networking. These Campuses have already been 
conducting MBA, BCA, PGDCA and CCA courses since their inception. The Planning Commission of India, following an 
objective evaluation, sanctioned Rs 10 crore for the development of these Campuses. The University on its part has allocated 
another Rs 10 crore for raising new buildings and infrastructure to meet the newer demands of the students and faculty vis-
√†-vis needs and requirements of the evolving world liberalization, privatization and globalization.**<br><br>
