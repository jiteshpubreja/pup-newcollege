@section('aboutcontent')



Punjabi University, Patiala, has kept up its spree of winning the highest "A" grade on a four-point scale amongst over 350 
universities in the country.  The status is awarded by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), which 
is an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission, for a period of five years. The rare status is given by 
the NAAC on the basis of overall performance of a University sduring a space of five years.  Punjabi university was earlier 
given "five star level" by the NAAC for the period covering March 2002-2007. The NAAC has reformatted the grading 
system from "five stars to one star level" to from "A to C" grade, equating "five stars" with "A" grade.<br><br>

              The 10-member NAAC team had visited the University from August 26 to 28 last and scanned the
  activities and achievements of its various departments to review the accomplishments at micro and macro levels. Disclosing the
  "prestigious honour" bestowed upon the University, Vice-Chancellor, Dr Jaspal Singh said that NAAC team had made a 
  special mention about the fact that the University has not deviated from its statutory and fundamental responsibility of 
  promoting the cause of Punjabi language, art and culture. The carrying forward of the utilitarian and qualitative research 
  and use of innovative techniques by various department were the other major factors which contributed towards its 
  retaining the highest status, he said. The grading, he added, was important for any University in ways more than one as it 
  helped it in getting enhanced grants from various funding agencies for the promotion of academic and research activities 
  and establishing tie-ups with prestigious institutions and organizations of national and international standing.<br><br>
